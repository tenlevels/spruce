Hello and farewell,

Thank you all for the support. The reception for spruce has been amazing. It is time for me to take a step back and focus on my family.

Please enjoy this limited TL edition of spruce. My device has this exact set up. :)

UPDATE: After 1,000 downloads I have removed the TL edition. If you missed it... maybe ask around. Cheers.

**SPRUCE 2.0 AVAILABLE HERE**
visit https://github.com/spruceUI/spruceOS - SundownerSport has the keys now

What makes 2.0 and TL different?
_2.0 is the real public release found on the new spruceUI GitHub, TL is "tenlevels" edition for fun and a farewell. You could say TL also stands for "totally limited". Meaning lots of features are not available. Think of it as MinUI's and Onion's teenage brother.  Full of  angst.  ðŸ¤£_ 

This community is so great.

Cheers!
