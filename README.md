# spruce: *SD Card Overhaul for Miyoo A30*

  - Spruce is not really an operating system (OS) on its own.
  - We think spruce is best described as being a beautification and optimization of the stock Miyoo OS that cleans up bloat, optimizes performance and focuses on aesthetics.
  - Spruce is intended to be sleek, intuitive, efficient and user friendly, we hope that you enjoy it.
