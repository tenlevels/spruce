  N64/DC/PSP*

  - Consider these "BONUS". If any games play and you enjoy it, GREAT! Do not expect these systems to run smooth. Again... Bonus!
  - N64 controls - The controller mapped on a hanheld is funky. Will wait for the community to let us know what they like for controls and will update.

 ARCADE GAMES:

  - Arcade is set to use FBNEO to allow save states to function. MAME 2003 Plus is also included in the .ADD ONS folder. Save state is not supported in MAME.

 
 PICO-8 GAMES:

   - We strongly encourage you to buy and support Pico-8. https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php?#getpico8 You will need to purchase the Raspberry Pi version to obtain the dat and dyn files.

   - PICO-8 games will launch native from the roms folder. Place your games in the CARTS folder. You need to provide your own dat and dyn files and place them in the bin folder located in sdcard/App/PICO/bin. You can also use splore with Wi-Fi to browse and play games by launching it from the App. There are so many wonderful games and they seem to just keep getting better. Pico-8 is a great way for indie game makers to create and share with the world. We cannot say enough good things about Pico-8. Enjoy!


  *Fake08 is also included.

  Unfortunately MainUI is causing issues to launch Pico-8 games using the png extension with Fake08.
  
  - Change the game to p8 extension by deleting .png from your cart file. 
  A tool like ReNamer is very helpful and will bulk perform the task for you. https://www.den4b.com/products/renamer

      Example:
        Tomb of G'Nir.p8.png
        to
        Tomb of G'Nir.p8



BIOS

  - Place your BIOS files in the BIOS folder on root of SD card.



RETROARCH*

  - Do not adjust settings in retroarch unless you are familiar with it.
  Removing or changing settings may cause games or controls to not work correctly. Default settings are of Miyoo and will remove all the custom configuration done for spruce.



THEMES

  - Included are 3 themes located in Settings. I plan on adding more icons and themes in the future.
  You can add themes from your Miyoo Mini or MMP. NOTE that there will be missing assets as the a30 has additional ones.
